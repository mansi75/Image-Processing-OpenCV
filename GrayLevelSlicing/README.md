## **Gray Level Slicing**

---

Gray level slicing manipulates group of intensity levels in an image up to specific range by diminishing rest or by leaving them alone. Grey level slicing without background displays high values in the specific region of an image and low value to other regions by ignoring background. In this notebook an image is taken where a range is highlighted and reducing other to constant level.
