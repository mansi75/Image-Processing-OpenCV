## **Scharr Transformation**

---

Scharr is also used to detect the second derivatives of an image in horizontal and vertical directions. You can perform scharr operation on an image using the method scharr(). 

This method accepts the following parameters :-

1. src − An object of the class Mat representing the source (input) image.

2. dst − An object of the class Mat representing the destination (output) image.

3. ddepth − An integer variable representing the depth of the image (-1)

4. dx − An integer variable representing the x-derivative. (0 or 1)

5. dy − An integer variable representing the y-derivative. (0 or 1)
